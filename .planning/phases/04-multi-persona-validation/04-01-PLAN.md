<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create unmotivated capable persona (Jordan)</name>
  <files>.claude/skills/lesson-designer/personas/unmotivated_capable.json</files>
  <action>
Create JSON persona file for Jordan - a capable but unmotivated student.

**Persona profile:**
- persona_id: "unmotivated_capable"
- persona_name: "Jordan"
- description: "10th grade student with above-grade-level ability but low engagement due to lack of perceived relevance"

**Characteristics (based on research):**
- cognitive_ability: grade_equivalent 12, actual_grade 10, processes_complex_tasks true, critical_thinking_skills high
- motivation: task_value low, sees_relevance false, effort_avoidance true, responds_to_choice true, responds_to_autonomy true
- engagement: boring_work_tolerance zero, relevance_threshold high, prefers_challenge true, prefers_real_world true
- work_habits: minimum_effort true, deadline_driven true, quality_when_interested high

**Evaluation criteria (5):**
1. task_relevance - Does the lesson connect to student interests or real-world applications?
2. cognitive_challenge - Is the work intellectually stimulating (not busywork)?
3. student_choice - Are there opportunities for student agency?
4. real_world_connection - Does it matter beyond the classroom?
5. autonomy_opportunities - Can students work at their own pace/approach?

**Decision rules with severity thresholds:**
- relevance: Flag activities without clear real-world connection
  - high: Abstract practice with no relevance explanation
  - medium: Some relevance but weak connection to student life
  - low: Relevance present but could be strengthened
- challenge: Flag tasks below grade level or lacking intellectual depth
  - high: No higher-order thinking; all retrieval/comprehension
  - medium: Some analysis but insufficient challenge
  - low: Adequate challenge but extension opportunities missing
- choice: Flag lessons with no student input on approach or product
  - high: Entirely teacher-directed, single path, no options
  - medium: Limited choices (pick A or B only)
  - low: Some choice but more could be offered
- real_world: Flag pure academic exercises with no application
  - high: Abstract skills with no context (e.g., "analyze this because it's on the test")
  - medium: Weak connection to real use case
  - low: Connection exists but could be more compelling
- autonomy: Flag rigid pacing with no flexibility
  - high: Everyone must do same thing at same time
  - medium: Some flexibility in timing only
  - low: Pace flexibility but not approach flexibility

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create interested capable persona (Maya)</name>
  <files>.claude/skills/lesson-designer/personas/interested_capable.json</files>
  <action>
Create JSON persona file for Maya - an engaged, capable student who wants depth.

**Persona profile:**
- persona_id: "interested_capable"
- persona_name: "Maya"
- description: "11th grade student with strong academic skills and genuine interest in learning, seeks depth and exploration"

**Characteristics:**
- cognitive_ability: grade_equivalent 12, actual_grade 11, processes_complex_tasks true, abstract_thinking strong
- motivation: intrinsic_motivation high, curiosity high, task_persistence high, seeks_understanding true
- engagement: participates_actively true, asks_questions true, goes_beyond_requirements true, wants_depth true
- learning_style: prefers_inquiry true, enjoys_discussion true, likes_research true, self_directed true

**Evaluation criteria (5):**
1. depth_opportunities - Does the lesson allow for deeper exploration?
2. inquiry_support - Are there opportunities for student-driven questions?
3. discussion_quality - Is there substantive academic discourse?
4. extension_availability - Are there paths for going beyond the basics?
5. intellectual_rigor - Is the content challenging and meaningful?

**Decision rules with severity thresholds:**
- depth: Flag surface-level content without exploration opportunities
  - high: Single "right answer" tasks with no room for deeper analysis
  - medium: Some depth but exploration capped by task design
  - low: Good depth but no explicit extension paths
- inquiry: Flag lessons that don't encourage student questions
  - high: Entirely receptive; students never generate questions
  - medium: Limited question opportunities (only Q&A at end)
  - low: Questions welcomed but not structured into activities
- discussion: Flag activities that don't leverage peer discourse
  - high: No collaborative or discussion components
  - medium: Discussion present but shallow (share answers only)
  - low: Discussion exists but prompts could be more substantive
- extension: Flag lessons without paths for advanced work
  - high: All students do identical work regardless of mastery
  - medium: Extensions mentioned but not planned
  - low: Extensions available but not compelling
- rigor: Flag activities below students' intellectual capacity
  - high: Only retrieval and basic comprehension tasks
  - medium: Analysis present but routine/formulaic
  - low: Good rigor but could push further

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create high achieving persona (Marcus)</name>
  <files>.claude/skills/lesson-designer/personas/high_achieving.json</files>
  <action>
Create JSON persona file for Marcus - a high-achieving gifted student.

**Persona profile:**
- persona_id: "high_achieving"
- persona_name: "Marcus"
- description: "9th grade gifted student (140 IQ equivalent) who quickly masters grade-level content and needs advanced challenges"

**Characteristics (based on gifted education research):**
- cognitive_ability: grade_equivalent 12+, actual_grade 9, rapid_mastery true, advanced_reasoning true, pattern_recognition excellent
- motivation: achievement_oriented true, perfectionist_tendencies true, frustrated_by_slow_pace true, needs_challenge true
- engagement: disengages_when_bored true, excels_with_complexity true, peer_interaction_varies true, prefers_autonomy true
- learning_needs: curriculum_compacting true, acceleration_ready true, abstract_concepts_preferred true, real_problems_valued true

**Evaluation criteria (5):**
1. challenge_level - Is the cognitive demand appropriate for gifted learners?
2. pacing_flexibility - Can advanced students move faster or go deeper?
3. abstract_complexity - Are there opportunities for abstract/theoretical work?
4. ceiling_removal - Is there unlimited ceiling for exploration?
5. meaningful_work - Is the work substantive (not more of the same)?

**Decision rules with severity thresholds:**
- challenge: Flag tasks that are too easy for gifted learners
  - high: All tasks at grade level; no above-level options
  - medium: Some advanced tasks but still capped at grade level+1
  - low: Advanced options exist but not sufficiently challenging
- pacing: Flag rigid pacing that forces gifted students to wait
  - high: Lock-step instruction; everyone moves together
  - medium: Some flexibility but gifted still waiting frequently
  - low: Flexibility exists but not for content acceleration
- abstract: Flag exclusively concrete/practical without theoretical
  - high: All concrete examples; no theoretical or abstract extension
  - medium: Some abstraction but stays close to examples
  - low: Abstraction available but teacher-led only
- ceiling: Flag tasks with capped expectations
  - high: "Complete these 10 problems" with no option for more
  - medium: Extensions available but feel like busywork ("do 5 more")
  - low: Ceiling exists but reasonable extension paths
- meaningful: Flag repetitive practice without new intellectual work
  - high: Practice identical to what was demonstrated (drill)
  - medium: Some variation but fundamentally same work
  - low: Meaningful but could be more substantive for gifted

**Note:** Include characteristic about needing "different work, not more work" - gifted students benefit from compacting and extension, not additional repetition.

1. All 3 JSON files are valid and parseable
2. Each file has persona_id, persona_name, description, characteristics, evaluation_criteria (5 items), decision_rules (5 rules with severity_thresholds)
3. Schema matches struggling_learner.json structure for PersonaEvaluator compatibility
4. Decision rules have high/medium/low severity thresholds that are actionable (not vague)
5. Characteristics reflect research-based learner profiles (unmotivated = relevance/autonomy, interested = depth/inquiry, high-achieving = challenge/ceiling)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
