# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2025-01-25)

**Core value:** Produce classroom-ready materials that actually work for teaching — slides that support instruction, worksheets with room to write, discussions with clear structure, and differentiation built in from the start.

**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Core Lesson Generation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Core Lesson Generation)
Plan: Ready to plan
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2025-01-25 — Roadmap created with 5 phases covering all 31 v1 requirements

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: N/A
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap creation: Adopted research-recommended 5-phase approach (core → quality → single persona → multi-persona → sequences) to de-risk file generation and feedback loops before scaling complexity

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 readiness:**
- Library availability: Need to verify python-pptx and docxtpl are available in Claude environment during planning
- Marzano framework reference: Need to validate framework documentation size doesn't exceed token limits

**Phase 5 readiness:**
- Context management: Multi-lesson sequences require empirical testing of context compression strategies (flagged in research)

## Session Continuity
