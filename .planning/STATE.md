# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2025-01-25)

**Core value:** Produce classroom-ready materials that actually work for teaching — slides that support instruction, worksheets with room to write, discussions with clear structure, and differentiation built in from the start.

**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Core Lesson Generation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Core Lesson Generation)
Plan: 1 of 6 complete
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-25 — Completed 01-01-PLAN.md (Foundation setup)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 10%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 8 min
- Total execution time: 8 minutes

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-core-lesson-generation | 1 | 8min | 8min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (8min)
- Trend: Baseline established

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **Roadmap creation (Phase 0):** Adopted research-recommended 5-phase approach (core → quality → single persona → multi-persona → sequences) to de-risk file generation and feedback loops before scaling complexity
- **Cognitive rigor threshold (01-01):** Set 40% minimum higher-order thinking (analysis + knowledge utilization) based on educational research. Enforced in Stage 3b validation
- **7-stage workflow structure (01-01):** Linear workflow separates lesson design (Stages 1-4) from file generation (Stages 5-6) to enable future enhancements without redesigning core
- **Template creation approach (01-01):** Python script generates Office files programmatically for reproducibility. Templates verified with python-pptx/python-docx before committing

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 readiness:**
- ✓ Library availability: Verified python-pptx, python-docx, and docxtpl are available (installed in 01-01)
- ✓ Marzano framework reference: Created MARZANO.md (610 lines) - well within token limits

**Phase 5 readiness:**
- Context management: Multi-lesson sequences require empirical testing of context compression strategies (flagged in research)

**No active blockers** for Phase 1 continuation.
