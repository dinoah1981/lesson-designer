# Evidence-Based ELA Pedagogy Research (Grades 9-12)

**Domain:** English Language Arts Instruction - Secondary Education
**Researched:** January 31, 2026
**Confidence:** HIGH

---

## Executive Summary

Evidence-based ELA pedagogy for grades 9-12 centers on **student-centered, process-oriented instruction** that prioritizes meaning-making over form-first approaches. The research reveals a clear consensus across multiple 2025-2026 sources: effective secondary ELA instruction involves **workshop models** (reading and writing), **gradual release of responsibility**, **formative assessment with actionable feedback**, and **authentic tasks** that connect to students' lived experiences.

The **workshop model** remains the gold standard for secondary ELA, consisting of:
- **Mini-lessons** (10-15 minutes max)
- **Extended independent/collaborative work time** (30-45 minutes)
- **Conferring** (one-on-one or small group, 2-5 min per student)
- **Share/reflection** (5-10 minutes)

This structure supports differentiation through choice, conferring, and scaffolding while maintaining high expectations for all learners. **Reader response theory** provides the foundation for text analysis, emphasizing transaction between reader and text rather than teacher-imposed interpretations.

**Direct instruction has a critical but limited role:** It's essential for foundational skills (vocabulary, grammar, text structures) and explicit strategy instruction, but should consume **no more than 25% of lesson time**. The remaining 75% should involve active student practice, discussion, and independent application.

**Writing instruction must be process-oriented, not form-first**—the five-paragraph essay is widely criticized as pedagogically harmful by UC Berkeley and multiple other sources. Instead, writing develops through authentic purposes, mentor texts, drafting/revision cycles, and formative feedback.

**Discussion-based learning** (Socratic seminars, literature circles) shows strong evidence for developing critical thinking, textual comprehension, and collaborative skills. A 2025 meta-analysis found literature circles produce a **large effect size (d=1.035)** on reading comprehension. These approaches require explicit teaching of discussion norms and analytical skills before gradual release to student-led formats.

## Key Findings by Instructional Approach

### 1. Workshop Models (Reading & Writing Workshop)

#### Structure & Components
**Core architecture (verified across multiple sources):**
- **Mini-lesson (10-15 min):** Connection → Teach → Active Engagement → Link
- **Work time (30-45 min):** Independent reading/writing + conferring
- **Share/Debrief (5-10 min):** Student sharing, metacognitive reflection

**Mini-lesson best practices:**
- **Optimal length:** 10-15 minutes maximum (research shows student engagement drops after 10 min)
- **Single focus:** One skill, strategy, or concept per lesson
- **4-step structure:**
  1. **Connection** (1-2 min): Link to previous learning, activate prior knowledge
  2. **Teach** (4-6 min): Explicit instruction with modeling
  3. **Active engagement** (3-5 min): Guided practice ("We do")
  4. **Link** (1-2 min): Connect to independent work

**Work time structure:**
- Students engage in **independent reading/writing** (choice-based)
- Teacher conducts **2-5 minute conferences** with individual students or small groups
- **Conference structure (Research-Decide-Teach):**
  - Research: Ask what student is working on, observe work
  - Decide: Identify one teaching point
  - Teach: Provide specific, actionable feedback on one thing
- **Conferring frequency:** Aim for 4+ students per 20-minute block

**Evidence:**
- Lucy Calkins' workshop model widely adopted K-12
- IES 2025 Practitioner's Guide endorses workshop structure for literacy improvement
- Reading/writing conferences are "the heart of any workshop classroom" and "differentiation at its finest"

**Actionable for lesson designer:**
- **Enforce time limits:** Flag lessons with mini-lessons >15 minutes
- **Structure template:** Connection → Teach → Active Engagement → Link as default
- **Conferring protocols:** Provide templates for conference notes (what student is doing, teaching point, next steps)
- **Single focus rule:** Validate that each mini-lesson teaches ONE clear objective

---

### 2. Reader Response Theory & Student-Centered Text Analysis

#### Core Principles (Rosenblatt)
**Transaction model:** Reading is a two-way process where the reader brings their entire self (prior knowledge, experiences, beliefs) to create meaning in conversation with the text.

**"Responsible reading" requirements:**
- Cite textual evidence
- Make best interpretation based on evidence
- Explain reasoning throughout

**Classroom implementation:**
- **Student choice is essential:** Students should always have choice in how to respond (increases motivation, authenticity, variety, agency)
- **Writing fluency:** Practice reading responses 2+ times per week
- **Metacognition:** Students think about their thinking (what kind of thought is this?)
- **Connection types:**
  - Text-to-self
  - Text-to-text
  - Text-to-world

**Instructional activities:**
- Small/large group discussions
- Literature circles
- Creative writing in response
- Dramatic/artistic activities

**Evidence:**
- Reader response is foundational to ELA pedagogy (Rosenblatt's theory dates to 1938 but remains current)
- Supports student agency and engagement
- Aligns with constructivist learning theory

**Actionable for lesson designer:**
- **Response variety:** Provide multiple response format options (written, artistic, dramatic, discussion)
- **Choice integration:** Build choice menus for text analysis tasks
- **Evidence requirement:** All response activities must include "cite textual evidence" component
- **Metacognitive prompts:** Include reflective questions (Why did this resonate? What thinking strategy did you use?)

---

### 3. Close Reading Approaches

#### Definition & Purpose
**Close reading:** Careful, repeated exploration and analysis of complex texts to gain more than students would from reading alone.

**Core benefits:**
- Develops literacy and critical-thinking skills
- Deepens understanding through multiple readings
- Makes real-life connections to text

#### Instructional Sequence (Serravallo 3-step model)

**Step 1: Establish Focus (1 minute)**
- Explain why text was selected
- State what students should gain from reading
- Activate relevant background knowledge
- Preview strategies needed

**Step 2: Reading & Rereading (8-13 minutes)**
- Guide students through text slowly, processing in chunks
- **Multiple readings with different purposes:**
  - Read 1: Literal comprehension (what does it say?)
  - Read 2: Deeper meaning (what does it mean?)
  - Read 3: Craft and structure (how does it work?)
- Use **turn-and-talk**, **annotation**, **choral reading** as appropriate
- Teacher decides reading modality based on student capability

**Step 3: Clarify Takeaways (1 minute)**
- Articulate transferable strategies ("strategies we practiced today that you can do anytime")
- Reinforce key information or vocabulary

#### Best Practices
- **Text selection criteria:**
  - Enough complexity to warrant multiple readings
  - Understanding benefits larger lesson/unit goals
  - Appropriate cognitive demand
- **Annotation skills:** Teach students to annotate strategically, not highlight everything
- **Context matters:** Embed close reading in instructional context that values collaboration and talk
- **No one-size-fits-all:** Strategies vary by text type, purpose, student needs

**Evidence:**
- Widely endorsed since Common Core adoption
- Repeated readings with annotation deepen comprehension
- Effectiveness depends on text selection and scaffolding

**Actionable for lesson designer:**
- **3-read template:** Structure close reading lessons with three distinct reading purposes
- **Time allocation:** Total 10-15 minutes for complete close reading sequence
- **Annotation guidance:** Provide specific annotation focus for each reading (e.g., "Mark unknown words" → "Underline central claim" → "Note author's word choices")
- **Text complexity checker:** Ensure selected texts warrant multiple readings
- **Integration requirement:** Close reading must connect to larger unit goals

### 4. Writing Process Pedagogy (vs. Product-Focused)

#### The Problem with Form-First Pedagogy

**Five-paragraph essay criticism (UC Berkeley, multiple sources):**
- **Does not encourage critical thinking** about writing strengths/weaknesses
- **Turns writing into a checklist** of features
- **No professional writers use this form**
- **Creates false comfort** of formula instead of genuine writing skills
- **Students become hyper-focused on form, not purpose/function**

**Research finding:** Students arrive in grade 10 "without basic skills to write accurately, effectively, and stylishly" because they've learned templates, not writing.

#### Process Approach (WRITE Center Summit 2025)

**February 2025 recommendations from 25 scholars at UC Irvine:**
- Nine recommendations for improving secondary writing instruction
- Seven recommendations for future research
- Emphasis on **cognitive, social, and affective dimensions** of writing

**Key components:**
1. **Pre-writing:** Brainstorming, planning, researching
2. **Drafting:** Getting ideas on paper without perfection pressure
3. **Feedback:** Peer and teacher response focused on content/ideas
4. **Revision:** Substantive changes to content, organization, argument
5. **Editing:** Surface-level corrections (grammar, spelling, punctuation)
6. **Publishing/Sharing:** Authentic audience for final product

**Time allocation:**
- **25% of lesson time** should be spent doing independent, purposeful writing in silence
- Focus on practicing and developing something specific
- Use **live modeling, drills, drafting, reflecting, and editing**

**Balance product and process:**
- "A focus on process should not be misunderstood as the neglect of product"
- Process results in product that must conform to discourse community standards
- Avoid both extremes: pure process (no standards) and pure product (no development)

**Evidence:**
- Donald M. Murray's 1972 "Teach Writing as a Process Not a Product" foundational
- 2025 WRITE Center summit consensus on process pedagogy
- Research shows form-first instruction "prevents young writers from learning how to write"

**Actionable for lesson designer:**
- **Ban five-paragraph templates:** Do not generate rigid essay formats
- **Process stages:** Structure writing lessons across pre-writing → drafting → feedback → revision → editing
- **Authentic purposes:** Every writing task should have clear real-world purpose and audience
- **Time for writing:** Ensure 25%+ of lesson includes actual writing time
- **Mentor texts:** Use published examples to show how writing works, not as templates to copy
- **Revision cycles:** Build in multiple revision opportunities with feedback between drafts

---

### 5. Socratic Seminars & Discussion-Based Learning

#### Socratic Seminar Structure

**Definition:** A formal discussion based on a text where the leader asks open-ended questions to encourage critical thinking and civil engagement with peers' viewpoints.

**Essential components:**

**1. Text Selection**
- Ambiguous short stories
- Contrasting primary documents
- Controversial topics
- Materials that invite genuine inquiry

**2. Student Preparation**
- Announce seminars in advance
- Students annotate texts with sticky notes
- Pre-write responses to opening question

**3. Question Development (Teacher)**
- Open-ended questions emphasizing exploration, not right answers
- Bookend questions connecting to students' lived experiences
- Avoid yes/no or fact-recall questions

**4. Norms Establishment**
- Collaboratively distinguish **discussion** (inquiry-based, responsive) from **debate** (persuasion-focused, adversarial)
- Agree on participation expectations
- Establish respectful challenge protocols

**5. Facilitation**
- Teacher minimizes participation, offers only procedural guidance
- Students drive substantive exploration
- Students hold each other accountable to norms

#### Learning Benefits
- Develops critical thinking and analytical reasoning
- Builds textual comprehension and interpretive depth
- Fosters collaborative inquiry
- Students practice articulating thoughts while respectfully challenging peers
- Shows students they are "seen" at school (social-emotional benefit)

**Evidence:**
- Research shows effectiveness in K-12 and higher education
- Supports meta-cognitive and critical thinking skills
- Improves social-emotional well-being through connection
- 2025 research confirms continued effectiveness for university literature classes

**Actionable for lesson designer:**
- **Seminar protocol:** Provide complete Socratic seminar structure (text selection → preparation → norms → question stems → facilitation notes)
- **Open-ended questions only:** Validate that discussion questions cannot be answered with yes/no or single facts
- **Preparation time:** Build in class time for annotation and pre-writing
- **Norm-setting:** Include collaborative norm-setting activity before first seminar
- **Assessment focus:** Assess inquiry process and participation, not "correct" interpretations

---

### 6. Literature Circles & Collaborative Inquiry

#### Structure & Effectiveness

**2025 Meta-Analysis Findings:**
- **15 studies analyzed**
- **Large effect size: d=1.035** on reading comprehension
- Effective for both EFL and ESL contexts
- Moderating variables: education level/age group, assessment formats

**March 2025 study:**
- Control group reading comprehension: +4.93%
- Experimental group (reading circles): +17.73%
- Benefits: comprehension, social skills, critical thinking, collaboration, individual working skills

#### Pedagogical Benefits
- Improved comprehension skills
- More confidence and participation
- Enhanced motivation
- More oral proficiency
- Enriched scaffolding opportunities
- Reinforced writing skills

#### Theoretical Foundation
**Social constructivism (Vygotskian):**
- Emphasizes social interaction and scaffolding for cognitive development
- Students co-construct meaning through discussion, interpretation, reflection
- Collaborative learning environments support knowledge building

#### Why They Work
- Combine most effective strategies: **independent reading + collaborative discussion + student-centered learning**
- Students take on different roles (discussion director, passage master, word wizard, connector, etc.)
- Heterogeneous grouping supports peer learning
- Student choice in book selection increases engagement

**Evidence:**
- 2025 meta-analysis shows strong empirical support
- Grounded in established learning theory
- Widely used and effective across contexts

**Actionable for lesson designer:**
- **Role cards:** Provide literature circle role definitions and question stems
- **Group size:** 4-6 students per circle (research-based optimal size)
- **Book choice:** Students select from 3-5 pre-approved options at appropriate complexity
- **Meeting structure:**
  - Independent reading (at home or in class)
  - Preparation using role sheets
  - Circle meeting (20-30 min discussion)
  - Reflection/extension activity
- **Rotation:** Roles rotate each meeting so all students practice all thinking types
- **Assessment:** Focus on preparation quality, participation, and depth of analysis

### 7. Direct Instruction in ELA: When It Works vs. When It Doesn't

#### When Direct Instruction IS Effective

**For foundational reading skills (K-5, but also struggling secondary readers):**
- Phonological awareness
- Phonics
- Fluency
- **Evidence:** Common Core requires "early, systematic, and explicit teaching" of these skills

**For English Learners (all levels):**
- ALL English learners should receive "comprehensive, evidence-based language and literacy instruction"
- Core instruction should be "explicit, systematic, and differentiated"
- Beginning ELs (levels 1-3) at higher grades benefit from **stand-alone direct ELD instruction**
- **Rationale:** Basic language skills require explicit instruction that may not align to content standards

**For explicit strategy instruction:**
- Text structure analysis
- Annotation strategies
- Discussion protocols
- Grammar/conventions in context
- Vocabulary (when combined with semantic mapping and contextual use)

**Explicit instruction components (I Do, We Do, You Do):**
- Clear explanations
- Demonstration through modeling
- Guided student practice
- Independent application with support

**Evidence:**
- Research demonstrates value of explicitly and systematically teaching foundational skills
- Effective for struggling readers at all grade levels
- Particularly important for English learners

#### When Direct Instruction DOES NOT Work

**For meaning-making and interpretation:**
- Reader response requires students to construct their own meaning
- Teacher-imposed interpretations undermine critical thinking
- Discussion-based approaches more effective than lecture

**For writing development:**
- Form-first direct instruction (five-paragraph essay model) "prevents young writers from learning how to write"
- Process approaches (with scaffolded support) more effective than direct teaching of formats

**For extended lesson time:**
- Research shows students go off-task after 10 minutes of instructional activity
- Mini-lessons should be 10-15 minutes maximum
- Remaining time should be student practice, not continued teacher talk

**For independent reading:**
- "Unsupported independent reading doesn't actually foster reading achievement"
- But explicit instruction on text selection + reading strategies + feedback DOES work
- Balance: direct teach strategies → students apply independently → teacher confers

#### The 25/75 Rule

**Recommendation from multiple sources:**
- **25% of lesson time:** Direct instruction, modeling, guided practice
- **75% of lesson time:** Independent/collaborative application, practice, discussion

**Evidence:**
- Aligns with workshop model research
- Supports gradual release of responsibility
- Prevents student disengagement

**Actionable for lesson designer:**
- **Time validation:** Flag lessons where teacher talk exceeds 25% of total time
- **Explicit instruction for:**
  - Foundational skills (especially for struggling readers, ELs)
  - Strategy instruction (annotation, discussion norms, text structures)
  - Vocabulary (with active engagement, not just definitions)
  - Grammar/conventions (in context of authentic writing)
- **Student-centered instruction for:**
  - Text interpretation and analysis
  - Writing development (process-based)
  - Discussion and collaboration
  - Independent reading/writing practice
- **Gradual release template:** I Do (teacher model) → We Do (guided practice) → You Do (independent) with clear transitions

## Formative Assessment & Feedback Structures

### NCTE Position Statement on Formative Assessment (2025)

**Core principles:**
- Instruction and assessment are "inextricably linked and oftentimes inseparable"
- Assessment is integral part of teaching, not an add-on
- Teachers should maintain an "inquiry stance": continually ask what students know and are ready to learn

**Student role:**
- Students as **coinquirers** in the learning process
- Agency in demonstrating understanding through varied methods
- Involvement in analyzing assessment data alongside teachers
- Opportunities for reflection on own learning
- Clear understanding of learning goals and feedback purposes

**Feedback design:**
- Answer three questions: "Where am I going? How am I going? Where to next?"
- Must be "non-evaluative, specific, and timely"
- Relate directly to clearly articulated learning goals
- Support metacognitive growth through deliberate reflection
- Culturally responsive, grounded in "ethic of care rather than consequences"

**Quality feedback improvement:**
- Improve feedback "that we give students, that students give us, and that students give themselves"
- Triangulate data from multiple sources: parents, teachers, community members

**Evidence:**
- 2025 research shows teachers' written and corrective feedback explains 35% of variance in students' love of learning
- Formative assessment provides feedback to improve teaching effectiveness
- Helps students understand limitations and teachers tailor lessons to needs

### Practical Formative Assessment Strategies for ELA

#### 1. Writing Conferences (2-5 minutes per student)
**Structure:**
- Research: What is the student working on?
- Decide: Identify one teaching point
- Teach: Provide specific, actionable feedback

**Best practices:**
- Teach the writer, not just edit the piece
- One teaching point per conference
- Start with compliment
- End with next step

#### 2. Reading Conferences (3-5 minutes per student)
**Structure:**
- What are you reading? How's it going?
- Can you read a bit to me? (fluency check)
- Tell me about what you just read (comprehension check)
- Teach one strategy based on observation

#### 3. Peer Assessment for Writing
**Benefits:**
- Gives multilingual learners more chances to show progress
- Students practice giving and receiving feedback
- Develops meta-cognitive awareness

**Structure:**
- Specific feedback protocol (e.g., TAG: Tell what you like, Ask a question, Give a suggestion)
- Focus on one element (e.g., evidence, organization, voice)
- Written feedback before oral discussion

#### 4. Self-Assessment & Reflection
**Prompts:**
- What reading/writing strategy did you use today?
- What was challenging? How did you overcome it?
- What would you like to work on next?
- How does this connect to your goals?

#### 5. Language Portfolios
**Benefits:**
- Learners track their own learning experience
- Reflect on progress over time
- Promotes critical thinking
- Provides evidence for growth

**Contents:**
- Drafts showing revision process
- Reflections on learning
- Goal-setting documents
- Evidence of strategy use

**Actionable for lesson designer:**
- **Conference templates:** Provide note-taking structures for teacher use
- **Feedback protocols:** Include TAG, 2 Stars and a Wish, etc. with stems
- **Self-assessment prompts:** Embed metacognitive reflection at lesson end
- **Feedback quality check:** Ensure feedback is specific (not "good job"), timely (same day), non-evaluative (focused on improvement, not grades)
- **Student involvement:** Build in opportunities for students to give feedback to teacher and to themselves
- **Multiple sources:** Include peer feedback, self-assessment, and teacher feedback in writing lessons

---

## Choice, Autonomy & Student Engagement

### Research on Choice & Motivation (2025 studies)

**February 2025 meta-analysis:**
- Strategies giving students control over their learning and offering choices help students feel they have freedom
- Makes students more likely to "engage willingly and enthusiastically"

**Chinese senior high school English classrooms (Feb-Mar 2025):**
- Autonomy support involves teachers "granting students freedom during learning activities, nurturing their needs and interests"
- Students who perceive autonomy show "greater curiosity and desire to challenge and engage more seriously"

**Technical English classrooms (May 2025):**
- Giving learners freedom increased motivation and engagement
- Improved performance in English class
- "Introducing the concept of freedom of choice can increase learners' motivation"
- Novelty of having freedom encourages active participation

**EFL undergraduate students (May 2025):**
- Chinese students have limited opportunities to make choices due to teacher-driven teaching styles
- "Teachers should encourage independent learning as students are more likely to be motivated when their autonomy needs are satisfied"

### Theoretical Framework (Self-Determination Theory)
**Autonomy-supportive interaction:**
- Provides social and supportive context
- Helps students become autonomous and independent learners
- When learners are given freedom to make choices about education, they are "likely to feel more enthusiastic and engaged"

### Practical Applications for Choice

#### Reader's Workshop Choice
- Text selection: students choose from leveled options
- Response format: written, artistic, dramatic, discussion
- Reading pace: within reasonable timeframe, students control pacing

#### Writer's Workshop Choice
- Topic selection (within genre/unit constraints)
- Audience/purpose for writing
- Mentor text selection
- Revision priorities
- Publishing format

#### Task Choice Menus/Boards
- Provide 3-5 options for demonstrating understanding
- All options meet same learning objective
- Vary by interest, learning style, complexity
- Include one "student-designed" option

**Evidence:**
- Multiple 2025 studies confirm positive effects on motivation and engagement
- Learner choice has "significant effects on L2 task engagement"
- Freedom increases motivation even when tasks are challenging

**Actionable for lesson designer:**
- **Build choice at multiple points:** Text selection, response format, topic selection, task options
- **Choice menus:** Provide 3-5 task options that meet same learning objective
- **Parameters within freedom:** Choice exists within teacher-designed structure (not unlimited choice)
- **Gradual release of choice:** Year begins with scaffolding and parameters, more choice released as students develop skills
- **Student-designed option:** Always include "propose your own" option for advanced students
- **Avoid false choice:** All options should be equally valuable and appropriately challenging

---

## Differentiation & Scaffolding Strategies

### Differentiation Principles (2025 research)

**Definition:** "A process through which teachers enhance learning by matching student characteristics to instruction and assessment"

**Differentiate by:**
- **Content:** What students learn (complexity, reading level)
- **Process:** How students learn (scaffolds, grouping)
- **Product:** How students demonstrate learning (format options)

**In response to:**
- **Readiness:** Current skill/knowledge level
- **Interest:** Topics/themes that engage students
- **Learning profile:** Preferred learning modes, strengths

**For heterogeneous classrooms:**
- Wide proficiency gaps are common in secondary ELA
- "Teachers often cater to the average student, neglecting both the 'strong' and the 'weak'"
- Differentiation addresses characteristics and circumstances of each student

### Scaffolding Strategies for ELA (Louisiana DOE August 2025)

#### 1. Sentence Frames/Thinking Stems
**Purpose:** Give students starting points for articulating ideas

**Examples:**
- "The text suggests that _____ because _____."
- "I agree/disagree with _____ because _____."
- "This connects to _____ because _____."

#### 2. Pre-Teaching Vocabulary
**Purpose:** Ensure terminology doesn't become roadblock

**Process:**
- Introduce key vocabulary before lesson
- Explain in context
- Review terms during lesson
- Students use words in discussion/writing

#### 3. Mentor Texts (High-Impact Practice)
**Purpose:** Allow students to observe how authors organize content, use language, apply conventions

**Process:**
- Analyze text structures and language patterns
- Name what the author is doing
- Practice similar strategies in own writing
- Especially beneficial for English learners

#### 4. Visual Aids & Graphic Organizers
**Purpose:** Make thinking visible, organize complex information

**Types:**
- Story maps
- Venn diagrams for comparison
- T-charts for analysis
- Annotation guides
- Planning webs for writing

#### 5. Chunking Complex Tasks
**Purpose:** Break down complex concepts into smaller, manageable parts

**Process:**
- Identify discrete skills needed
- Teach one element at a time
- Include modeling and guided practice
- Build toward complete complex task

#### 6. Structured Collaboration
**Purpose:** Peer support for developing writers

**Tools:**
- Sentence starters
- Vocabulary supports
- Peer collaboration protocols
- Discussion role cards

#### 7. Gradual Release Across a Unit
**Writing instruction stages:**
- **Joint construction:** Class co-constructs text, discusses structure/content/language decisions
- **Scaffolded practice:** Students write with supports (frames, organizers, peer collaboration)
- **Independent construction:** Students apply learning independently

### Differentiation for Reading Levels

**Grouping recommendations:**
- **Struggling readers:** 1-4 students per group
- **On-level readers:** 5-8 students per group
- **Rationale:** Smaller groups = more practice opportunities with teacher feedback

**Approaches:**
- Same text with differentiated supports (annotations, vocabulary pre-teaching, audio support)
- Tiered texts on same theme/topic (varied complexity)
- Student choice within appropriate complexity band
- Literature circles with leveled book options

**Evidence:**
- Differentiation is "key to reaching learning goals" by targeting skills students lack
- Benefits students of all intellectual and physical ability levels
- 2025 research validates effectiveness across proficiency levels

**Actionable for lesson designer:**
- **Scaffolding library:** Provide sentence frames, graphic organizers, annotation guides
- **Pre-teaching option:** Build in vocabulary pre-teaching for struggling students
- **Mentor text integration:** Include mentor text study before student writing tasks
- **Chunking guidance:** Break multi-step tasks into discrete components
- **Grouping guidance:** Recommend group sizes based on student needs
- **Tiered task options:** Provide on-level, approaching, and advanced versions of tasks
- **UDL principles:** Multiple means of representation, engagement, and expression
- **Gradual release:** Joint construction → scaffolded practice → independent application

## What NOT to Do: Ineffective Practices to Avoid

### From "What Doesn't Work: Literacy Practices We Should Abandon" (Edutopia)

#### 1. "Look Up the List" Vocabulary Instruction
**Why it doesn't work:** Less effective than semantic mapping, discussing words in context, relating new words to known words

**What to do instead:**
- Semantic mapping
- Contextual use and discussion
- Word relationships and categories

#### 2. Unsupported Independent Reading (DEAR, SSR)
**Why it doesn't work:** Programs like Drop Everything and Read don't improve achievement without teacher guidance

**What to do instead:**
- Instruction on text selection strategies
- Conferring about reading strategies
- Feedback on reading
- Post-reading discussion or response activities

#### 3. Round-Robin Reading
**Why it doesn't work:** "Isn't just ineffective; it can be harmful, especially for students who struggle with reading fluency"

**What to do instead:**
- Choral reading
- Partner reading
- Teacher read-aloud with think-aloud
- Independent silent reading with purpose

#### 4. Three-Cueing Method
**Why it doesn't work:** Research shows it's ineffective; 33+ states have banned it

**What is it:** Encouraging students to sample letters and words, relying mostly on prediction and context for comprehension

**What to do instead:**
- Explicit phonics instruction (for struggling readers)
- Decoding strategies
- Comprehension strategies with strong decoding foundation

#### 5. Traditional Vocabulary via Dictionary Definitions
**Why it doesn't work:** "Looking up words in the dictionary and writing definitions doesn't build vocabulary"

**What to do instead:**
- Semantic mapping
- Word relationships
- Contextual use
- Discussion of words

### From Research on Secondary ELA Instruction

#### 6. Five-Paragraph Essay Template
**Why it doesn't work:**
- Turns writing into checklist, not critical thinking
- No professional writers use this form
- Creates false comfort of formula
- Students focus on form, not purpose/function
- "Prevents young writers from learning how to write"

**What to do instead:**
- Process writing with authentic purposes
- Mentor text analysis
- Genre study (learn features, not templates)
- Revision focused on content and craft

#### 7. Teacher-Dominated Lessons
**Why it doesn't work:**
- Students go off-task after 10 minutes of lecture
- Doesn't support active learning or meaning-making
- No opportunity for formative assessment
- Limits student agency and engagement

**What to do instead:**
- 25% direct instruction / 75% student practice
- Workshop model with mini-lessons
- Gradual release: I Do → We Do → You Do

#### 8. Assessment Without Feedback
**Why it doesn't work:**
- Grades alone don't improve learning
- Students need specific, actionable guidance
- Misses opportunity for growth

**What to do instead:**
- Non-evaluative, specific, timely feedback
- Revision opportunities after feedback
- Student involvement in assessment (self-assessment, peer feedback)

#### 9. Form-First Writing Instruction
**Why it doesn't work:**
- "Students are hyper-focused on form and not thinking at all about the purpose or function"
- "Writing is treated as a unitary, context-free activity about reproducing generalized patterns"
- Results in students finishing KS3 "without the basic skills they need to write accurately, effectively, and stylishly"

**What to do instead:**
- Writing with authentic purposes and audiences
- Process over product
- 25% of lesson time = independent, purposeful writing
- Live modeling, drafting, reflecting, editing

**Actionable for lesson designer:**
- **Red flags to detect:**
  - Dictionary-only vocabulary work
  - Unsupported silent reading without conferring
  - Round-robin reading protocols
  - Five-paragraph essay templates or rigid formats
  - Lessons where teacher talks >75% of time
  - Assessment without actionable feedback
  - Form before purpose in writing
- **Replacement recommendations:**
  - Vocabulary: semantic maps, word relationships, contextual use
  - Reading: choice + conferring + response activities
  - Writing: process-based with authentic purposes
  - Instruction: 25% teacher / 75% student practice
  - Assessment: specific feedback + revision cycles

## Standards Alignment & Backward Design

### Understanding by Design (UbD) Framework for ELA

**Wiggins & McTighe three stages:**

**Stage 1: Identify Desired Results**
- Review ELA standards for unit
- Determine enduring understandings (big ideas students remember years later)
- Determine essential questions (open-ended, intellectually engaging)

**Stage 2: Determine Assessment Evidence**
- Design summative assessment BEFORE lessons
- Could be essay, project, performance task, portfolio
- Align to standards and essential questions
- Design rubric with clear criteria

**Stage 3: Plan Learning Experiences**
- Create series of lessons that purposefully lead to desired outcomes
- Scaffold from foundational skills to complex application
- Include formative assessments throughout

**Why it works for ELA:**
- Prioritizes meaningful outcomes over content coverage
- Ensures coherence between learning goals, assessment, instruction
- "Teaching with the end in mind"

### Application to Automated Lesson Design

**Phase 1: Goal Setting**
- Input: standard(s), competency, or essential question
- Output: Learning objective (student-friendly), success criteria, enduring understanding

**Phase 2: Assessment Design**
- Determine: How will students demonstrate mastery?
- Consider: Performance task, writing assignment, discussion, portfolio, project
- Create: Rubric or success criteria

**Phase 3: Lesson Sequencing**
- Scaffold: Foundational skills → Application → Transfer
- Build: Each lesson prepares for next
- Include: Formative assessment checkpoints

**Actionable for lesson designer:**
- **Start with standard:** All lesson design begins with standard/competency input
- **Assessment before instruction:** Generate assessment task/rubric before lesson activities
- **Backward design template:** Essential question → Summative assessment → Lesson sequence
- **Success criteria:** Make learning goals transparent to students
- **Transfer goal:** Every unit should build toward independent application beyond classroom

## Key Takeaways for Automated Lesson Design Tool

### MUST Support (Evidence-Based Best Practices)

#### 1. Workshop Structure with Time Enforcement
- **Mini-lessons ≤15 minutes** (flag violations)
- **Work time ≥20-30 minutes** (50-60% of lesson)
- **Conferring time built in** (4-6 students per lesson)
- **Closure ≥5 minutes** (non-negotiable)

#### 2. Student Choice at Multiple Points
- Text selection (3-5 leveled options)
- Response format (written, artistic, dramatic, discussion)
- Task options (choice menus/boards)
- Include "student-designed" option

#### 3. Process Orientation for Writing
- **Never generate five-paragraph essay templates**
- Structure: Pre-writing → Drafting → Feedback → Revision → Editing → Publishing
- Include mentor text analysis
- Authentic purposes and audiences
- 25%+ of lesson time = actual writing time

#### 4. Formative Assessment Integration
- Conference note-taking templates (Research-Decide-Teach)
- Peer feedback protocols (TAG, 2 Stars & a Wish)
- Self-assessment prompts (metacognitive reflection)
- Feedback must be specific, timely, non-evaluative

#### 5. Discussion Protocols
- Socratic seminar structure (text selection, norms, open-ended questions, debrief)
- Literature circle roles and schedules
- Open-ended question stems (not yes/no or fact-recall)
- Assessment of process, not predetermined answers

#### 6. Gradual Release Sequences
- I Do (teacher model) → We Do (guided practice) → You Do (independent)
- Clear transitions between phases
- Check for understanding before releasing

#### 7. Authentic Purposes
- Connect reading/writing to real-world contexts
- Student-selected texts (within complexity parameters)
- Audiences beyond teacher
- Tasks relevant to students' lived experiences

#### 8. Scaffolding Library
- Sentence frames/thinking stems
- Graphic organizers
- Annotation guides
- Vocabulary support
- Mentor texts

### MUST Avoid (Ineffective Practices)

#### 1. Form-First Templates
- No five-paragraph essay generators
- No rigid writing formats before purpose/audience
- No "fill in the blank" literary analysis

#### 2. Teacher-Dominated Lessons
- Flag if teacher talk >25% of lesson time
- Enforce mini-lesson time limits
- Require substantial student practice time

#### 3. Unsupported Independent Work
- Choice requires scaffolding
- Independent reading requires conferring + feedback + response activities
- Independent writing requires conferring + revision cycles

#### 4. Harmful Reading Practices
- No round-robin reading protocols
- No three-cueing strategies
- No "look up the list" vocabulary only

#### 5. Assessment Without Feedback
- Never grade without actionable feedback
- Require revision opportunities after feedback
- Include peer and self-assessment options

### Design Principles

#### 1. 25/75 Rule
- 25% direct instruction (mini-lesson)
- 75% student practice/application (work time + closure)
- Automatically calculate and flag violations

#### 2. Single Focus
- Each mini-lesson teaches ONE skill/strategy
- Validate: can learning objective be stated in one sentence?
- Flag lessons trying to cover too much

#### 3. Backward Design
- Start with standard/competency
- Design assessment before lesson activities
- Lessons scaffold toward assessment

#### 4. Student Agency
- Build choice at minimum 2 points per lesson
- Include student voice in closure (sharing work)
- Metacognitive reflection required

#### 5. Differentiation by Design
- Provide scaffolds (don't require teachers to create them)
- Offer tiered task options
- Include extension options for advanced learners

#### 6. Culturally Responsive
- Diverse examples across cultures
- Multiple perspectives on texts
- Student choice allows connection to own interests/experiences

## Open Questions for Tool Design

### 1. How prescriptive should the tool be about workshop structure?
- **Enforce** (hard limits on mini-lesson time, require conference time)?
- **Recommend** (suggest structure, allow teacher override)?
- **Hybrid** (defaults to best practice, teacher can customize)?

### 2. How to balance teacher autonomy with evidence-based constraints?
- Allow "override" of research-based recommendations?
- Require justification for deviating from best practices?
- Provide explanations for all recommendations?

### 3. Should the tool generate discussion questions or curate teacher-created ones?
- AI-generated: faster, customized to text
- Teacher-created database: higher quality, but limited coverage
- Hybrid: AI generates, teacher refines?

### 4. How to handle the tension between standardization (efficiency) and customization (student needs)?
- Templates are efficient but risk one-size-fits-all
- Full customization is pedagogically sound but time-intensive
- Solution: smart defaults with customization options?

### 5. How to validate text complexity matching?
- Use Lexile/other quantitative measures?
- Require teacher judgment of qualitative features?
- Combine automated measures with teacher input?

### 6. How to provide formative feedback on lesson quality?
- Validate against research-based criteria (time allocation, single focus, etc.)?
- Provide "lesson quality score" with specific improvement suggestions?
- Flag common pitfalls (too much teacher talk, no closure, etc.)?

### 7. How to build scaffolds without over-scaffolding?
- Default to moderate scaffolding, teacher adjusts?
- Tiered scaffolding options (minimal, moderate, extensive)?
- Student-specific scaffold recommendations based on readiness?
