# Mathematics Pedagogy Quick Reference Guide

**For:** Automated Lesson Design System
**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Source:** Evidence-based research on grades 9-12 mathematics instruction

## Decision Tree: Content Type → Lesson Structure

```
START: What type of content am I teaching?

├─ DISCOVERED CONCEPT (relationships, patterns, function behavior)
│  └─> Use: Launch-Explore-Summarize (45-60 min)
│      Launch (10) → Explore (25) → Summarize (15)
│      Rationale: Students can discover what mathematicians discovered
│
├─ DECIDED CONVENTION (notation, vocabulary, terminology)
│  └─> Use: Direct Instruction + Application (20-30 min)
│      Explain (10) → Model (5) → Apply (10)
│      Rationale: Cannot be discovered; must be told
│
├─ NEW PROCEDURE (equations, factoring, algorithms)
│  └─> Use: CRA Sequence (2-4 lessons)
│      Concrete (Lesson 1) → Representational (Lesson 2) → Abstract (Lesson 3)
│      Rationale: Build conceptual foundation before symbolic work
│
├─ PROCEDURE PRACTICE
│  ├─ IF student is NOVICE
│  │  └─> Use: Worked Example → Faded → Practice (45-60 min)
│  │      Worked (15) → Faded (20) → Independent (15)
│  │      Rationale: Reduce cognitive load for beginners
│  │
│  └─ IF student is PROFICIENT/EXPERT
│     └─> Use: Problem-Solving + Discussion (45-60 min)
│         Problem (25) → Discuss (15) → Practice (10)
│         Rationale: Worked examples are redundant/harmful for experts
│
└─ PROBLEM-SOLVING / APPLICATION
   └─> Use: Teaching Through Problem-Solving (45-60 min)
       Pose (10) → Investigate (25) → Discuss (15) → Consolidate (5)
       Rationale: Learn mathematics BY solving problems
```

## Critical Research Findings

### 1. Expertise Reversal Effect (CRITICAL)
**What:** Instructional methods effective for novices can produce NEGATIVE outcomes for experts
**Example:** Worked examples help novices but waste experts' time and reduce learning
**Action:** ALWAYS assess prior knowledge and adjust scaffolding

### 2. Conceptual BEFORE Procedural (NCTM Official Position)
**What:** "Conceptual understanding must precede and coincide with procedural instruction"
**NOT:** Concept → Procedure (strictly sequential)
**YES:** Concept ⇄ Procedure (iterative, mutually reinforcing)
**Action:** Every procedural lesson needs conceptual foundation (CRA Concrete phase)

### 3. Productive Struggle Window
**Sweet Spot:** 15-30 minutes of exploration
**Too Little:** No meaningful learning
**Too Much:** Frustration, giving up
**Action:** Allocate exploration time, transition to discussion even if incomplete

### 4. "I Do, We Do, You Do" is NOT Best Practice
**Research Finding:** Gradual release prevents authentic problem-solving
**Problem:** When teacher demonstrates solution, students follow steps without understanding
**Exception:** Use ONLY for conventions or formalization after exploration
**Action:** Default to Launch-Explore-Summarize or Teaching Through Problem-Solving

### 5. Teaching THROUGH vs. FOR Problem-Solving
**THROUGH:** Students learn NEW math BY solving problems (preferred for concepts)
**FOR:** Practice applying KNOWN skills to problems (appropriate for consolidation)
**ABOUT:** Teach generic strategies like "draw a picture" (research shows ineffective)
**Action:** Use THROUGH for introducing concepts, FOR for practicing skills

## Lesson Structure Templates

### Template 1: Launch-Explore-Summarize (Discovered Concepts)

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes

**Launch (10 min):**
- Present problem creating "need" for new content
- Activate prior knowledge
- Ensure understanding of WHAT (not HOW)
- Set expectations for exploration

**Explore (25 min):**
- Students grapple with problem using current knowledge
- Teacher monitors, takes notes on strategies
- Teacher asks probing questions (not leading)
- Select 3-4 students with different approaches

**Summarize (15 min):**
- Students share strategies (correct AND instructive errors)
- Compare approaches
- Teacher makes connections explicit
- Formalize concept and vocabulary

**Example:** Introduce exponential functions through "rumor spreading" problem

### Template 2: CRA Sequence (New Procedures)

**Duration:** 2-4 lessons

**Lesson 1 - Concrete (50 min):**
- Model with physical manipulatives
- Students manipulate objects to solve
- Focus: WHY procedure works (physical model)
- Materials: Algebra tiles, fraction bars, geometric models

**Lesson 2 - Representational (50 min):**
- Draw pictures representing concrete objects
- Explicitly connect to previous lesson's manipulatives
- Bridge physical to symbolic
- Materials: Graph paper, diagram templates

**Lesson 3 - Abstract (50 min):**
- Standard symbolic procedure
- Connect to concrete and representational work
- Emphasize efficiency grounded in understanding
- Return to earlier phases if students struggle

**Example:** Solve equations using tiles → drawings → symbols

### Template 3: Worked Example → Faded → Practice (Novices Only)

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes

**⚠️ WARNING:** Only use for NOVICE learners. Skip for proficient/expert (expertise reversal).

**Worked Example (15 min):**
- Teacher solves complete example with think-aloud
- Highlight decision points
- Connect to underlying concepts
- Students observe and take notes

**Faded Examples (20 min):**
- Example 1: Teacher does steps 1-4, student does 5-6
- Example 2: Teacher does steps 1-3, student does 4-6
- Example 3: Teacher does steps 1-2, student does 3-6
- Example 4: Teacher does step 1, student does 2-6

**Independent Practice (15 min):**
- Varied problems (not repetitive drill)
- Students solve independently
- Teacher provides feedback

### Template 4: Teaching Through Problem-Solving

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes

**Pose Problem (10 min):**
- Authentic, engaging mathematical situation
- Open-ended or multiple solution paths
- Connected to students' experiences

**Investigate (25 min):**
- Individual or small group work
- Teacher facilitates, doesn't direct
- Questions extend thinking (not lead to answers)

**Discuss (15 min):**
- Share multiple solution strategies
- Student-to-student interaction
- Compare approaches, defend reasoning

**Consolidate (10 min):**
- Connect informal exploration to formal mathematics
- Introduce precise vocabulary
- Formalize procedures or concepts
- Make broader connections

### Template 5: Direct Instruction + Application (Conventions Only)

**Duration:** 20-30 minutes

**Explain (10 min):**
- State convention/vocabulary explicitly
- Rationale: "Mathematicians agreed to..."
- Multiple examples of use

**Model (5 min):**
- Demonstrate using convention in context
- Show correct and incorrect usage

**Immediate Application (10 min):**
- Practice opportunities with feedback
- Check for correct usage

**Example:** Teaching function notation f(x), domain/range terminology

## 5 Practices for Orchestrating Discussion

**Use when:** Lesson includes student problem-solving (any content type)

### Before Lesson: ANTICIPATE
- Solve problem multiple ways
- Predict student strategies (correct and incorrect)
- Anticipate misconceptions
- Prepare questions for each approach

### During Student Work: MONITOR
- Circulate and observe
- Note which strategies students actually use
- Take notes on monitoring sheet
- Compare to anticipated solutions

### During Student Work: SELECT
- Choose specific students to present
- Criteria: variety of approaches, instructive errors, elegant solutions
- Aim for 3-4 different strategies

### Transition to Discussion: SEQUENCE
- Order presentations strategically
- Common patterns:
  - Concrete → Pictorial → Abstract
  - Simple → Complex
  - Inefficient → Efficient
  - Incorrect → Correct
  - Multiple correct approaches

### During Discussion: CONNECT
- Ask comparison questions: "How is this similar/different?"
- Highlight connections: "Both methods show..."
- Make mathematics explicit: "What we've discovered is..."
- Connect to formal mathematics
- Synthesize learning

## Productive Struggle Scaffolding Guide

### Four Types of Struggle + Teacher Response

| Struggle Type | Student Says/Does | Teacher Response | What NOT to Do |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Get Started** | "I don't know what to do" | Probing: "What do you know? What are you trying to find?" | Tell them how to start |
| **Carry Out Process** | Has approach but stuck on execution | Directed guidance: "Would a table help?" | Solve it for them |
| **Give Explanation** | Can solve but can't articulate | Probing: "Why did you choose that? What pattern?" | Accept answer without reasoning |
| **Express Misconception** | Reveals flawed understanding | Affordance: Provide counterexample or tool | Correct directly without exploration |

### Time Guidelines
- 0-5 min: Clarify problem understanding only
- 5-15 min: Ask probing questions
- 15-25 min: Provide directed guidance if needed
- 25+ min: Transition to discussion (struggle window closed)

## NCTM's 8 Effective Teaching Practices (Checklist)

Every lesson should address these:

- [ ] **1. Establish clear mathematics goals** (not just activity completion)
- [ ] **2. Implement high-cognitive-demand tasks** (reasoning, not just procedures)
- [ ] **3. Use and connect multiple representations** (concrete, visual, symbolic, contextual)
- [ ] **4. Facilitate meaningful mathematical discourse** (student-to-student, not just teacher-student)
- [ ] **5. Pose purposeful questions** (advance reasoning, not just check answers)
- [ ] **6. Build procedural fluency FROM conceptual understanding** (not before)
- [ ] **7. Support productive struggle** (scaffold, don't solve)
- [ ] **8. Elicit and use evidence of student thinking** (formative assessment throughout)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T: Use "I Do, We Do, You Do" as default structure
**Problem:** Prevents authentic problem-solving, creates procedural dependency
**Instead:** Launch-Explore-Summarize for concepts, CRA for procedures

### ❌ DON'T: Give worked examples to experienced students
**Problem:** Expertise reversal effect - wastes time, reduces learning
**Instead:** Provide challenging problems, minimal scaffolding

### ❌ DON'T: Teach procedures without conceptual foundation
**Problem:** Rote memorization, high error rates, no transfer
**Instead:** CRA sequence - concrete understanding before symbolic work

### ❌ DON'T: Immediately help when students struggle
**Problem:** Eliminates productive struggle, prevents sense-making
**Instead:** Wait 15+ minutes, ask probing questions before providing guidance

### ❌ DON'T: Use timed tests to assess fluency
**Problem:** Undermines fluency development, increases math anxiety
**Instead:** Assess efficiency, flexibility, and accuracy (not speed)

### ❌ DON'T: Teach generic problem-solving strategies ("draw a picture")
**Problem:** Research shows limited effectiveness, lacks mathematical substance
**Instead:** Teaching THROUGH problem-solving (learn content BY solving problems)

### ❌ DON'T: Limit students to single solution method
**Problem:** Denies access to intuitive approaches, prevents flexibility
**Instead:** Encourage multiple strategies, compare approaches

## Content Classification Keywords

**Use to classify learning objectives:**

### Discovered Concepts → Exploration First
Keywords: understand, explore, discover, relationship, pattern, why, investigate, compare, analyze, generalize
Examples: function behavior, geometric relationships, Pythagorean theorem

### Decided Conventions → Direct Instruction
Keywords: notation, symbol, vocabulary, terminology, definition, represent, name, label
Examples: f(x) notation, domain/range terms, perpendicular symbol ⊥

### Procedures → CRA or Worked Examples (expertise-dependent)
Keywords: solve, calculate, compute, find, determine, simplify, factor, graph, evaluate
Examples: solving equations, factoring polynomials, graphing functions

### Problem-Solving → Teaching Through Problem-Solving
Keywords: apply, use, create, model, design, prove, justify, explain, construct
Examples: optimization problems, proof construction, real-world modeling

## Quick Decision Algorithm

```python
# Pseudocode for lesson structure selection

if "notation" in objective or "vocabulary" in objective:
    structure = "direct_instruction_application"

elif "understand" in objective or "explore" in objective:
    structure = "launch_explore_summarize"

elif "solve" in objective or "calculate" in objective:
    if introducing_for_first_time:
        structure = "CRA_sequence"
    elif student_expertise == "novice":
        structure = "worked_example_faded_practice"
    else:  # proficient or expert
        structure = "problem_solving_discussion"  # Skip worked examples!

elif "apply" in objective or "model" in objective:
    structure = "teaching_through_problem_solving"

# Always add discussion orchestration if student work involved
if structure in ["launch_explore_summarize", "problem_solving", "teaching_through"]:
    apply_5_practices(structure)
```

## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before finalizing lesson, verify:

**Conceptual Foundation:**
- [ ] Procedures have concrete/representational phase (CRA)
- [ ] Exploration precedes formalization for concepts

**Productive Struggle:**
- [ ] 15-30 min allocated for exploration (not too little, not too much)
- [ ] Scaffolding questions prepared (not premature solutions)

**Scaffolding Matches Expertise:**
- [ ] Worked examples only for novices
- [ ] Minimal scaffolding for proficient/expert students
- [ ] No expertise reversal violations

**Discussion Structure:**
- [ ] Student sharing time allocated
- [ ] 5 Practices planning (anticipate, monitor, select, sequence, connect)
- [ ] Comparison questions prepared

**Multiple Representations:**
- [ ] At least 2-3 representation types (concrete, visual, symbolic, contextual)
- [ ] Explicit connections between representations

**Formative Assessment:**
- [ ] At least 2 checkpoints during lesson
- [ ] Evidence of student thinking elicited
- [ ] Instruction adjustable based on evidence

**Avoids Common Pitfalls:**
- [ ] No rote memorization emphasis
- [ ] No timed tests
- [ ] No single-method restriction
- [ ] Not entirely teacher-centered

## When in Doubt

**Default to this blended model:**
1. **Brief inquiry/exploration** (15-20 min) - Students attempt problem with current knowledge
2. **Discussion** (10 min) - Share approaches, identify patterns
3. **Explicit instruction** (10-15 min) - Formalize concepts, introduce vocabulary
4. **Guided practice** (10-15 min) - Apply with scaffolding
5. **Independent practice** (10 min) - Transfer to new contexts

This hybrid approach satisfies research requirements:
✓ Conceptual foundation through exploration
✓ Productive struggle opportunity
✓ Explicit instruction for formalization
✓ Procedural practice with conceptual connections
✓ Works for most content types
