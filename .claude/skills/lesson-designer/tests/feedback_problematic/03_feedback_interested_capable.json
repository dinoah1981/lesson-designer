    {
      "element": "depth_opportunities",
      "issue": "Limited opportunities for deeper exploration beyond basic content",
      "severity": "medium",
      "impact": "Maya may complete work quickly but feel intellectually unsatisfied",
      "evidence": "Tasks focus on correct answers without paths to deeper understanding",
      "recommendation": {
        "change": "Add explicit \"go deeper\" options or extension questions",
        "rationale": "Interested students benefit from structured paths to deeper content",

      "element": "inquiry_support",
      "issue": "No opportunities for student-generated questions or inquiry",
      "severity": "high",
      "impact": "Maya's natural curiosity has no outlet; learning feels passive and receptive",
      "evidence": "Lesson is entirely teacher-directed with no question generation",
      "recommendation": {
        "change": "Add structured opportunity for students to generate their own questions",
        "rationale": "Curious students learn better when pursuing their own questions",
        "implementation": "Include QFT (Question Formulation Technique) or \"What do you wonder?\" protocol"

    {
      "element": "discussion_quality",
      "issue": "Discussion present but shallow - sharing answers rather than building ideas",
      "severity": "medium",
      "impact": "Maya wants intellectual discourse, not just answer checking",
      "evidence": "Collaboration limited to answer comparison rather than idea development",
      "recommendation": {
        "change": "Deepen discussion prompts to push thinking beyond answer sharing",
        "rationale": "Substantive discourse requires prompts that invite multiple perspectives",
        "implementation": "Use prompts like \"What would you add to that idea?\" or \"What's another perspective?\""
      }
    },
    {
      "element": "extension_availability",
      "issue": "No extension or advanced paths - all students do identical work",
      "severity": "high",
      "impact": "Maya finishes quickly and has nothing meaningful to pursue",
      "evidence": "No differentiation or extension options mentioned in any activity",
      "recommendation": {
        "change": "Add intellectually rich extension options for students who finish early or want more",
        "rationale": "Interested students need pathways to deeper or broader exploration",
        "implementation": "Include \"take it further\" options with genuinely advanced work, not just more of the same"

    {
      "element": "intellectual_rigor",
      "issue": "Only retrieval/comprehension tasks - insufficient intellectual rigor",

      "impact": "Maya is intellectually capable of much more; lesson feels dumbed down",
      "evidence": "All activities at basic cognitive levels: ['retrieval', 'retrieval', 'retrieval']",
      "recommendation": {
        "change": "Add analysis, evaluation, or creation tasks requiring deeper thinking",
        "rationale": "Capable, interested students need cognitive challenge to stay engaged",
        "implementation": "Include tasks requiring comparison, synthesis, argument, or original thought"
