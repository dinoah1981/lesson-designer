      "severity": "high",
      "impact": "Marcus will master content in minutes and have nothing appropriate to do",
      "evidence": "Grade 10 lesson with no above-level paths or advanced tasks",
      "recommendation": {
        "change": "Add above-grade-level options or open-ended advanced challenges",
        "rationale": "Gifted students (3+ years ahead) need qualitatively different work",

      "element": "pacing_flexibility",
      "issue": "Limited pacing flexibility for students who master content quickly",
      "severity": "medium",
      "impact": "Marcus may finish early and wait; no option to move to advanced content",
      "evidence": "No explicit curriculum compacting or acceleration options",
      "recommendation": {
        "change": "Build in flexible pacing for students who demonstrate early mastery",
        "rationale": "Respecting gifted students' time shows they are valued",

      "severity": "medium",
      "impact": "Marcus's abstract reasoning abilities underutilized",
      "evidence": "Lesson stays close to concrete examples without theoretical extension",
      "recommendation": {
        "change": "Add \"big picture\" or theoretical extension for interested students",

      "element": "meaningful_work",
      "issue": "Majority of work is repetitive practice - meaningless for students who've mastered content",

      "impact": "Marcus already understands this; repetition is punishment, not learning",
      "evidence": "3 of 3 activities are drill/practice: ['Students copy definitions from the board', 'Students quiz each other on definitions', 'Practice quiz matching terms to definitions']",
      "recommendation": {
        "change": "Replace repetitive practice with substantive intellectual work for mastery students",
        "rationale": "Different work (not more work) - gifted students need challenge, not repetition",
        "implementation": "Offer application to complex scenario, creation task, or analysis instead of drill"
