# Marzano's New Taxonomy Reference

## Overview

Robert Marzano's New Taxonomy is a framework for designing instruction and assessment based on how humans process information. Unlike Bloom's taxonomy (which focuses on cognitive difficulty), Marzano's framework separates the **type of thinking** from the **level of difficulty**.

The taxonomy identifies four systems of thought that progressively build upon each other:

1. **Retrieval** - Recognizing and recalling information
2. **Comprehension** - Understanding and organizing information
3. **Analysis** - Reasoning with information
4. **Knowledge Utilization** - Applying information to real-world contexts

This framework guides lesson design by ensuring students engage with content at multiple cognitive levels, with emphasis on higher-order thinking (analysis and knowledge utilization) rather than rote memorization.

## Lesson Types and Marzano Level Distribution

Different lesson purposes require different cognitive distributions:

### Introducing New Knowledge

---

## Cognitive Rigor Requirements

### CRITICAL VALIDATION RULE

Every lesson must meet these thresholds:

**Minimum Requirements:**
- **40% minimum** of lesson time dedicated to higher-order thinking (Analysis + Knowledge Utilization combined)
- **30% maximum** of lesson time spent on Retrieval-only activities
- **No single level** should exceed 40% of total lesson time

**Recommended Distribution for Balanced Lesson:**
- 15% Retrieval
- 25% Comprehension
- 30% Analysis
- 30% Knowledge Utilization

### Why These Thresholds Matter

**Research basis:**
- Students retain information better when they use it in complex ways
- Higher-order thinking develops transfer skills
- Balanced cognitive engagement maintains engagement

**Red flags:**
- >30% Retrieval = Excessive rote memorization, low engagement
- <40% Higher-order = Insufficient depth, won't transfer to new contexts
- >60% Knowledge Utilization = May lack foundational knowledge

### Calculating Cognitive Rigor

**Formula:**
```
Level Percentage = (Total minutes at level) / (Total lesson duration) × 100

Higher-Order Percentage = (Analysis minutes + Knowledge Utilization minutes) / Total duration × 100
```

**Example Calculation:**

45-minute lesson:
- 5 min retrieval (vocabulary)
- 10 min comprehension (concept mapping)
- 15 min analysis (error analysis)
- 15 min knowledge utilization (design challenge)

Calculations:
- Retrieval: 5/45 = 11%
- Comprehension: 10/45 = 22%
- Analysis: 15/45 = 33%
- Knowledge Utilization: 15/45 = 33%
- Higher-order total: (15+15)/45 = 67% ✓ (exceeds 40% minimum)

**Result:** PASSES validation
